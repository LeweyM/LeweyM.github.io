<h1 id=finite-state-machines>Finite State Machines</h1>
<p>finite state machines are both simple and useful. The simplest definition I can think of is something like this;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A finite State Machine (FSM) is a series of states. The machine start in some state, then decides the next state to go to based on some input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the cool things about FSMs is that they can be drawn as lovely little circles and arrows representing <strong>states</strong> and <strong>transitions</strong>:</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220119151322.png alt=Pasted-image-20220119151322.png></p>
<p>This is the simplest. It&rsquo;s just a single state. The red circle in the middle means that we&rsquo;re currently in that state, although that doesn&rsquo;t tell us much yet&mldr;</p>
<p>For this to be useful, we need more than one state.</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220119151437.png alt=Pasted-image-20220119151437.png></p>
<p>This a two state system. Starting from the state on the left - we&rsquo;ll call it <code>state[0]</code> - we travel to the state on the right - <code>state[1]</code> - only if we see the character <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>Two things to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens if we process a different character to <code>c</code>, such as <code>z</code>? From the picture, we don&rsquo;t know what to do as there is no arrow for the <code>z</code> case. To be truly accurate, we would need to have an arrow for every possible character. For brevity, let&rsquo;s say that if there is no arrow, there was no match.</li>
<li>The circle on the right is blue. This means this is an <strong>end state</strong>. If we arrive at this state we have finished and a match has been found.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all lovely, but what can we actually do with this? We&rsquo;re going to use these machines to solve regular expressions.</p>
<h2 id=text-search>Text search</h2>
<p>let&rsquo;s create a state machine which checks if a string matches against a simple regular expression query <code>abc</code>. This means that any string containing the substring <code>abc</code> will match. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"zabcz"</code> -> match</li>
<li><code>"abc"</code> -> match</li>
<li><code>"abd"</code> -> no match</li>
<li><code>""</code> -> no match</li>
</ul>
<p>The finite state machine which represents this regular expression is as follows:</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710201842.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710201842.png></p>
<p>let&rsquo;s break this down a bit. Really, each state is saying something.</p>
<p>State 0 is saying: &ldquo;you have not yet seen anything interesting&rdquo;
State 1 is saying: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just seen <code>'a'</code>&rdquo;
State 2 is saying: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just seen <code>'ab'</code>&rdquo;
State 3 is saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just seen <code>'abc'</code> so you&rsquo;re done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get into these states and what they&rsquo;re saying a little more to try to understand all of these arrows.</p>
<p>At state 0, I still haven&rsquo;t seen anything interesting until I see an <code>'a'</code>, that&rsquo;s pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>At state 1, I know that the first character I saw as <code>'a'</code></p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710202102.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710202102.png></p>
<p>At state 2 we&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just seen <code>'ab'</code>.</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710202144.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710202144.png></p>
<p>And at state 3, we know we&rsquo;ve seen <code>'abc'</code>, so we don&rsquo;t want to do anything from here!</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710202159.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710202159.png></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really all there is to it. The interesting thing is how we can combine arrows and circles to create FSM that can represent complex regular expressions.</p>
<h2 id=getting-into-some-code>Getting into some code</h2>
<h3 id=the-fsm-data-structure>The FSM data structure</h3>
<p>We can first think about our core data structures to represent the FSM. The FSM is essentially a linked list of <code>state</code> objects.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type State struct {  
	connectedStates []State  
}
</code></pre><p>We need a bit more information, however, as we need to know which character allows us to go from one state to another. We&rsquo;ll use a <code>Transition</code> struct to represent this.</p>
<p>The <code>Transition</code> struct contains two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>the next state</li>
<li>the predicate that determines whether we can go to the next state</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type Transition struct {  
   // to: a pointer to the next state   
   to *State  
   // predicate: a function to determine if we should move to the next state
   predicate func(input rune) bool  
}  
</code></pre><p>The <code>Predicate</code> is a simple function that takes in a character (here we&rsquo;re using <code>rune</code> to avoid multi-byte character issues).</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type Predicate func(input rune) bool
</code></pre><p>Putting that together;</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type Predicate func(input rune) bool
  
type Transition struct {  
   to          *State  
   predicate   Predicate  
}  
  
type State struct {  
   transitions []Transition  
}

</code></pre><h3 id=running-our-state-machine>Running Our State machine</h3>
<p>Inorder to use our state machine, we&rsquo;ll need something that can process a string by running through the states, and that can give information on matches. As this is an object that runs through our state machine, we&rsquo;ll call this a <strong>Runner</strong>.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type runner struct {  
   head      *State  
}
</code></pre><p>For now, all our runner needs to have is a pointer to the root (or <code>head</code>) node of our FSM.</p>
<h3 id=tests-first>Tests first</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be following TDD principles when convenient in order to make sure things are working as expected (and because, personally, I find it more fun). As we now have our fundamental objects mapped out, we can now start writing some tests.</p>
<p>Our first test will check the behaviour of a simple FSM which represents the regex expression <code>abc</code>. The first thing to do is contruct the FSM. We&rsquo;ll do this &lsquo;by hand&rsquo; for now, and later we&rsquo;ll work on a <strong>compiler</strong> that can take a string like <code>"abc"</code> and build an FSM automatically.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>func TestHandmadeFSM(t *testing.T) {
	startState := State{}  
	stateA := State{}  
	stateB := State{}  
	stateC := State{}  
	  
	startState.transitions = append(startState.transitions, Transition{  
	   to:          &amp;stateA,  
	   predicate:   func(input rune) bool { return input == 'a' },  
	})  
	  
	stateA.transitions = append(stateA.transitions, Transition{  
	   to:          &amp;stateB,  
	   predicate:   func(input rune) bool { return input == 'b' },  
	})  
	  
	stateB.transitions = append(stateB.transitions, Transition{  
	   to:          &amp;stateC,  
	   predicate:   func(input rune) bool { return input == 'c' },  
	})
}
</code></pre><p>There&rsquo;s quite a bit going on here, so let&rsquo;s break it down a bit.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s remind ourselves of the FSM structure for the regex <code>abc</code></p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710201842.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710201842.png></p>
<p>There are 4 states which we have to define first.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>	startState := State{}  
	stateA := State{}  
	stateB := State{}  
	stateC := State{} 
</code></pre><p>Once we have our states, we need to describe the transitions between them. The first is the transition from the <code>startState</code> to <code>stateA</code>. To do this, we simply append a <code>Transition</code> object to the <code>transitions</code> property of <code>startState</code>. This new transition must point to <code>stateA</code>, and take as it&rsquo;s predicate a function that returns <code>true</code> if the input rune is <code>'a'</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>startState.transitions = append(startState.transitions, Transition{  
   to:          &amp;stateA,  
   predicate:   func(input rune) bool { return input == 'a' },  
})  
</code></pre><p>Same goes for the remaining states.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>	stateA.transitions = append(stateA.transitions, Transition{  
	   to:          &amp;stateB,  
	   predicate:   func(input rune) bool { return input == 'b' },  
	})  
	  
	stateB.transitions = append(stateB.transitions, Transition{  
	   to:          &amp;stateC,  
	   predicate:   func(input rune) bool { return input == 'c' },  
	})
</code></pre><p>We now have our first FSM starting at the root node <code>startState</code>. Let&rsquo;s write a test which creates a <code>runner</code> and uses this FSM to check against a few different input cases.</p>
<p>The outcome of running a string through an FSM should result in one of 3 statuses;</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Normal</code>. The FSM has not found a match yet, but neither has it found that there is no match. Another way of saying this is that the search is still &lsquo;in progress&rsquo;.
The cases we want to test are;</li>
<li><code>Success</code>. The FSM has found a match.</li>
<li><code>fail</code>. The FSM has found that the string does not match.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can define these as consts of a specific type.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type Status string  
  
const (  
   Success Status = &quot;success&quot;  
   Fail           = &quot;fail&quot;  
   Normal         = &quot;normal&quot;  
)
</code></pre><p>With that in mind we can think of a few cases to test our FSM and runner logic;</p>
<p><code>""</code> -> <code>normal</code>
<code>"x"</code> -> <code>fail</code>
<code>"abc"</code> -> <code>success</code>
<code>"ab"</code> -> <code>normal</code></p>
<p>Writing these up into table-style tests we get the following;</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type test struct {  
   name           string  
   input          string  
   expectedStatus Status  
}  
  
tests := []test{  
   {&quot;empty string&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Normal},  
   {&quot;non matching string&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, Fail},  
   {&quot;matching string&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, Success},  
   {&quot;partial matching string&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, Normal},  
}
</code></pre><p>The actual tests should simply create a runner using our hand-made FSM, iterate through the runes in the <code>input</code> string, and check that the <code>Status</code> of the runner is the same as our expected status.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>for _, tt := range tests {  
   t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {  
      testRunner := NewRunner(&amp;startState)  
  
      for _, character := range tt.input {  
         testRunner.Next(character)  
      }  
  
      result := testRunner.getTotalState()  
      if tt.expectedStatus != result {  
         t.Fatalf(&quot;Expected FSM to have final state of '%v', got '%v'&quot;, tt.expectedStatus, result)  
      }  
   })  
}
</code></pre><p>Notice that we had to invent a couple of methods to make this work, such as the <code>NewRunner</code>, <code>testRunner.Next</code> and <code>testRunner.getStatus</code>. This is fine, as we&rsquo;ll come back to implementing these in a moment.</p>
<p>All together, our first test looks like this;</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>func TestHandmadeFSM(t *testing.T) {  
   // hand-made FSM
   startState := State{}  
   stateA := State{}  
   stateB := State{}  
   stateC := State{}  
  
   startState.transitions = append(startState.transitions, Transition{  
      to:        &amp;stateA,  
      predicate: func(input rune) bool { return input == 'a' },  
   })  
  
   stateA.transitions = append(stateA.transitions, Transition{  
      to:        &amp;stateB,  
      predicate: func(input rune) bool { return input == 'b' },  
   })  
  
   stateB.transitions = append(stateB.transitions, Transition{  
      to:        &amp;stateC,  
      predicate: func(input rune) bool { return input == 'c' },  
   })  
  
   type test struct {  
      name           string  
      input          string  
      expectedStatus Status  
   }  
  
   tests := []test{  
      {&quot;empty string&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Normal},  
      {&quot;non matching string&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, Fail},  
      {&quot;matching string&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, Success},  
      {&quot;partial matching string&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, Normal},  
   }  
  
   for _, tt := range tests {  
      t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {  
         testRunner := NewRunner(&amp;startState)  
  
         for _, character := range tt.input {  
            testRunner.Next(character)  
         }  
  
         result := testRunner.getTotalState()  
         if tt.expectedStatus != result {  
            t.Fatalf(&quot;Expected FSM to have final state of '%v', got '%v'&quot;, tt.expectedStatus, result)  
         }  
      })  
   }  
}

</code></pre><p>Note: One might take a look at this test and say &ldquo;The states are being instantiated once and then used in every test. This is a bad practice as one test might affect the outcome of another.&rdquo; and I would totally agree. The only reason we&rsquo;re getting away with it here is because our State Machines are <strong>stateless</strong>, meaning they don&rsquo;t contain any information about the state of the process. On the other hand, our <code>runner</code> instance is <strong>stateful</strong>, so we want to create a new instance for every test case.</p>
<h3 id=compiling-a-finite-state-machine>Compiling a Finite State Machine</h3>
<p>We can break down the previous example of writing a FSM for the regular expression <code>abc</code> into a few at least 2 discrete steps;</p>
<ol>
<li>take <code>abc</code> and create a linked list of <code>'states'</code> with conditional transitions to other states.</li>
<li>process the input and move through the states.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call these steps <code>compile</code> and <code>evaluate</code>.</p>
<p><code>compile</code> means turning a string of characters that represent a valid regular expression into a linked list of states; a finite state machine. For this we will create a <code>Compiler</code> struct with a <code>Compile</code> method which takes a string and returns a <code>*State</code>.</p>
<p>(? too early for this?)
There are many ways of making compilers, but the one we&rsquo;re going to look at uses a stack as it&rsquo;s main data structure.</p>
