<h1 id=finite-state-machines>Finite State Machines</h1>
<p>finite state machines are both simple and useful. The simplest definition I can think of is something like this;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>One of the cool things about FSMs is that they can be drawn as lovely little circles and arrows representing <strong>states</strong> and <strong>transitions</strong>:</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220119151322.png alt=Pasted-image-20220119151322.png></p>
<p>This is the simplest. It&rsquo;s just a single state. The red circle in the middle means that we&rsquo;re currently in that state, although that doesn&rsquo;t tell us much yet&mldr;</p>
<p>For this to be useful, we need more than one state.</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220119151437.png alt=Pasted-image-20220119151437.png></p>
<p>This a two state system. Starting from the state on the left - we&rsquo;ll call it <code>state[0]</code> - we travel to the state on the right - <code>state[1]</code> - only if we see the character <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>Two things to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens if we process a different character to <code>c</code>, such as <code>z</code>? From the picture, we don&rsquo;t know what to do as there is no arrow for the <code>z</code> case. To be truly accurate, we would need to have an arrow for every possible character. For brevity, let&rsquo;s say that if there is no arrow, there was no match.</li>
<li>The circle on the right is blue. This means this is an <strong>end state</strong>. If we arrive at this state we have finished and a match has been found.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all lovely, but what can we actually do with this? We&rsquo;re going to use these machines to solve regular expressions.</p>
<h2 id=text-search>Text search</h2>
<p>let&rsquo;s create a state machine which checks if a string matches against a simple regular expression query <code>abc</code>. This means that any string containing the substring <code>abc</code> will match. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"zabcz"</code> -> match</li>
<li><code>"abc"</code> -> match</li>
<li><code>"abd"</code> -> no match</li>
<li><code>""</code> -> no match</li>
</ul>
<p>The finite state machine which represents this regular expression is as follows:</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710201842.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710201842.png></p>
<p>let&rsquo;s break this down a bit. Really, each state is saying something.</p>
<p>State 0 is saying: &ldquo;you have not yet seen anything interesting&rdquo;
State 1 is saying: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just seen <code>'a'</code>&rdquo;
State 2 is saying: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just seen <code>'ab'</code>&rdquo;
State 3 is saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just seen <code>'abc'</code> so you&rsquo;re done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get into these states and what they&rsquo;re saying a little more to try to understand all of these arrows.</p>
<p>At state 0, I still haven&rsquo;t seen anything interesting until I see an <code>'a'</code>, that&rsquo;s pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>At state 1, I know that the first character I saw as <code>'a'</code></p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710202102.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710202102.png></p>
<p>At state 2 we&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just seen <code>'ab'</code>.</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710202144.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710202144.png></p>
<p>And at state 3, we know we&rsquo;ve seen <code>'abc'</code>, so we don&rsquo;t want to do anything from here!</p>
<p><img src=/img/Pasted-image-20220710202159.png alt=Pasted-image-20220710202159.png></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really all there is to it. The interesting thing is how we can combine arrows and circles to create FSM that can represent complex regular expressions.</p>
<h2 id=getting-into-some-code>Getting into some code</h2>
<h3 id=the-fsm-data-structure>The FSM data structure</h3>
<p>We can first think about our core data structures to represent the FSM. The FSM is essentially a linked list of <code>state</code> objects, which in go are structs.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type State struct {  
	otherStates []State  
}
</code></pre><p>We need a bit more information, however, as we need to know which character allows us to go from one state to another. We&rsquo;ll use a <code>Transition</code> struct to represent this.</p>
<p>The <code>Transition</code> struct contains two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>the next state</li>
<li>the predicate that determines whether we can go to the next state</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type Transition struct {  
   // to: a pointer to the next state   
   to *State  
   // predicate: a function to determine if the runner should move to the next state
   predicate func(input rune) bool  
}  
</code></pre><p>The <code>Predicate</code> is a simple function that takes in a character (here we&rsquo;re using <code>rune</code> to avoid multi-byte character issues).</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type Predicate func(input rune) bool
</code></pre><p>Putting that together;</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type Predicate func(input rune) bool
  
type Transition struct {  
   to          *State  
   predicate   Predicate  
}  
  
type State struct {  
   transitions []Transition  
}

</code></pre><h3 id=compiling-a-finite-state-machine>Compiling a Finite State Machine</h3>
<p>We can break down the previous example of writing a FSM for the regular expression <code>abc</code> into a few at least 2 discrete steps;</p>
<ol>
<li>take <code>abc</code> and create a linked list of <code>'states'</code> with conditional transitions to other states.</li>
<li>process the input and move through the states.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call these steps <code>compile</code> and <code>evaluate</code>.</p>
<p><code>compile</code> means turning a string of characters that represent a valid regular expression into a linked list of states; a finite state machine. For this we will create a <code>Compiler</code> struct with a <code>Compile</code> method which takes a string and returns a <code>*State</code>.</p>
<p>(? too early for this?)
There are many ways of making compilers, but the one we&rsquo;re going to look at uses a stack as it&rsquo;s main data structure.</p>
