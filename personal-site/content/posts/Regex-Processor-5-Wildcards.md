title: Regex Processor 5 Wildcards
draft: false

Let's start adding some special regex characters, starting with the `'.'` wildcard regular expression.

### Wildcards

The `.` character in a regular expression will match any character. To make this clear, here are a few example cases for the regular expression `ab.`;

`abc` -> `success`
`ab` -> `normal`

So, let's add these as test cases in our code.

```diff

```
