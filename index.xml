The downsides to this approach is that in order to speed up transfer rates, we want to send many resource pieces in parallel. With HTTP/1, this means doing a new TCP handshake every-time, which is costly and time consuming. This was alleviated in a later version HTTP/1.</description></item><item><title>The Journey of a Refactor</title><link>https://leweym.github.io/posts/the-journey-of-a-refactor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leweym.github.io/posts/the-journey-of-a-refactor/</guid><description>Basically, I was trying to do something and went down the wrong path, and when I finally saw the light it all got a lot better.
Problem I’m trying to write a test that makes sure that no other fields in the db are effected when we write to the db - only the field that we care about. The issue is that when you decode a response from the db to a go struct, you can use known fields with a struct, or unknown fields with a map, but you can’t do a mix.</description></item></channel></rss>
